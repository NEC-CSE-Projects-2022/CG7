## Why This Dataset?

This dataset is widely used in medical data analytics for chronic kidney disease (CKD) research due to its real-world clinical relevance and high-quality annotations. It contains essential patient attributes such as blood pressure, biochemical test results, and comorbid conditions that are directly linked to kidney function assessment.

The dataset is well-suited for machine learning and deep learning models because it includes both numerical and categorical features, allowing effective evaluation of preprocessing, feature selection, and classification techniques. Its moderate size makes it ideal for experimentation, model comparison, and interpretability analysis without excessive computational cost.

Additionally, early detection of CKD is a critical healthcare challenge. Using this dataset enables the development and validation of predictive models that can support clinicians in early diagnosis, risk stratification, and decision-making, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing treatment costs.
